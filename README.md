# Theboys

This repository contains the final project for Programming 1 "The Boys" (2025/2 version) at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR),
under the supervision of Professor Giovanni Venâncio.The project was inspired by the TV series "The Boys" and involves a simulation-based scenario with heroes, bases, and missions.

## Scenario Concept
The simulation models a world inhabited by heroes, each defined by a unique set of skills (rated 0-10) and an evolving experience level. These heroes dynamically interact with a network of bases and respond to emerging missions throughout the simulation.
